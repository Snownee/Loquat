# Preface

Loquat is an area management mod for Minecraft map makers. You can take advantage of Minecraft's structure template
system and data-driven world generation with enhanced and scriptable features in Loquat.

Currently, Loquat is in BETA. Please understand that there may be bugs and changes in the future.

### You can use Loquat to...

- Create areas like WorldEdit and manage them.
- Trigger events when players enter or leave an area.
- Restrict player behavior in the area, such as entering, leaving, and breaking blocks.
- Summon mobs in an area in a data-driven manner, setting spawn conditions, monster waves, time limits, and scaling
  monster HP based on the number of players.
- Use the Structure Block to save and load areas along with blocks, to generate jigsaw structures later.
- Fully customize a randomized linear dungeon, with unlimited branches and rooms. Place it during world generation, or
  from the `/place` command.
- Wipe out the entire structure after a process is finished.

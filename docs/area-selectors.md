# Area Selectors

The area selector works pretty much like the [entity selector](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Target_selectors) in Vanilla. So I will not explain the basic syntax here. Before going into it, you should know you can use the UUID of an area to specify it in commands.

## Target selector variables

A target selector variable identifies the broad category of targets to select.

- `@a` - Selects every area.
- `@s` - Selects every selected area.
- `@r` - Selects a random area.
- `@p` - Selects the nearest area.

## Target selector arguments

After a target selector, optional arguments can be used to narrow down the set of targets to a group that also matches certain criteria. All the supported arguments are listed in suggestions in the game, they work the same way as the entity selector.
